## System Requirements
The following pieces of software are required for proper operation:
- Python >= 3.10

## Running the Program
1. Download and unpack the zip file.
2. Navigate to the src directory in your terminal: `cd src`.
3. Run the input.py file depending on your version of python: `python input.py`.
4. The GUI should initialize and start the program.
