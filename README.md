exemplification of two random objects, optimization, and omni-optimization for penalty,
possibility, and qualitative logics.

System Requirements:
The following pieces of software are required for proper operation Python >= 3.10 ,Tkinter and  Pysat.

pip install python-sat[pblib,aiger]  or pip install python3.10-'sat[pblib,aiger]' depending on your terminal.

In order to run the program  first download the zip file and unpacked it.  
After that in the terminal navigate inside the src directory cd src then run python input.py depending on your version of python.
